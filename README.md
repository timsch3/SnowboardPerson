# SnowboardPerson
My first try at finishing a simple physics based game made in the Godot engine: https://timsch3.github.io/SnowboardPerson/HTML5Export/snowboardperson.html

It's basically just one level but playable and I haven't experienced any breaking bugs yet. If the controls shown in the game don't work, just click inside the window.

Apparently people new to game development tend to make their games too hard, this may have happened here :)
